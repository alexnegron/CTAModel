# CTAModel
Models the Chicago CTA train system (final project for CS-201 at IIT, Spring 2020). Allows for the addition and removal of stations on each CTA line at the correct locations, updating all locations of the other stations. Most notably, allows one to generate routes between two stations, whether they are on the same line or not.
